Brenneris are particularly adept at detecting subtle physical and emotional reactions. This makes them especially skilled at understanding the emotions of others, and they are naturally talented diplomats.\n\nWhen brenneris developed space travel, they enthusiastically began making expeditions from their home world to nearby planets in hopes of learning from their galactic neighbors. They quickly found that their empathetic nature allowed them favorable interactions, even with typically aggressive species. The brenneris began to intentionally hone this skill into diplomacy, and once they developed hyperspace travel, they were welcomed with open arms. Now, a significant number of brenneris sell their skills as diplomats to other species that require ambassadors or that would prefer for brenneris to act on their behalf.\n\nBrenneri diplomats usually work in pairs, knowing that the experience and judgment of another brenneri is invaluable. Most other species allow brenneri to work as duos, even in cases where only a single representative would normally acts on behalf of a particular group, such as intergalactic senates.","items":"tactical baton, azimuth laser pistol with two batteries (20 charges each), precious object, graphite carbon skin","spellattack":{"value":"+12","benchmark":"high","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":20,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"savenote":"+1 status bonus to all saves vs. inhaled poisons","creature":"","speed":"25 feet, swim 20 foot ","imgurl":"http://rollforcombat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/otterfolk.jpg","spelltype":"Arcane Innate","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","mind reading (3)","","fear (3)","daze, telekinetic projectile, message"],"constant":"","strength":{"value":"+1","benchmark":"low","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"+1","benchmark":"low","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"0","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"+4","benchmark":"high","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"1","benchmark":"low","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+12","benchmark":"high","note":"(+2 on sense motive checks),darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"9","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"10","benchmark":"high","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"13","benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":""},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"18","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"46","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"10","benchmark":"high","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"8","benchmark":"low","note":""},"will":{"value":"12","benchmark":"high","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","strikes":[{"id":"_qam5o5jdbm","name":"tactical baton","traits":"thrown 10 ft","attack":"+8","damage":"1d6+5 bludgeoning","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_5mntnjmeq44","name":"Azimuth laser pistol","traits":"range increment 60, persistent 1d4 fire on critical, reload 1/20","attack":"+8","damage":"1d4+3 fire","type":"Ranged"}],"hints":["perception","strength","dexterity","constitution","intelligence","wisdom","charisma","ac","fortitude","reflex","will","hp"],"languages":"Common, brenneri, one planar language"}
