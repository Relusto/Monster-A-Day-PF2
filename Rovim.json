They come from the primal plane of chaos, they are known for being cute and adorable to many onlookers and travelers that find one or a group of them. They often beg for various scraps of food. Most Rovim can subsist on one piece of food such as a piece of an apple or a slice of bread.  Overfeeding a Rovim tends to cause it to go into a violent and disruptive craze that causes wanton destruction to its surroundings and others, thus named after Rovagug the rough beast.","items":"","spellattack":{"value":"5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"13","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"20 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"Divine Innate","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":" freedom of movement ","strength":{"value":"-3","benchmark":"terrible","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"3","benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"0","benchmark":"low","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"0","benchmark":"low","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"3","benchmark":"high","note":""},"perception":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"moderate","note":"entropy sense (imprecise) 30 feet, darkvision"},"acrobatics":{"value":"+8","benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"+8","benchmark":"extreme","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"high","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"high","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":15,"benchmark":"high","note":""},"hp":{"value":"8","benchmark":"moderate","note":"Fast healing 1"},"fortitude":{"value":"+2","benchmark":"low","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"+8","benchmark":"high","note":""},"will":{"value":"+5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":" precision 1, protean anatomy 1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"lawful 1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","strikes":[{"id":"_15mwt70tzhh","name":"jaws","traits":"","attack":"+5","damage":"1d4-3 piercing plus 1d4 chaotic","type":"Melee"},{"id":"_1fhnke2q3sy","name":"kick","traits":"agile","attack":"+5","damage":"1d4-3 bludgeoning plus 1d4 chaotic","type":"Melee"}],"hints":["perception","strength","dexterity","constitution","intelligence","wisdom","charisma","ac","fortitude","reflex","will","hp"],"languages":"Abyssal, Protean"}
